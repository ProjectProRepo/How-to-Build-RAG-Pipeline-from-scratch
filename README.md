# How to Build an RAG Pipeline from Scratch

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch. The pipeline enables efficient document retrieval and AI-powered response generation using FastEmbed, SQLite, and Groq AI.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Process and store text-based FAQs in a structured format.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Convert text into numerical embeddings for similarity search.
- **Database Storage**: Store and retrieve embeddings using SQLite.
- **Semantic Search**: Find the most relevant FAQ entries based on user queries.
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Generate customer support responses using Groq AI.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **FastEmbed** (for embedding generation)
- **SQLite** (for database storage)
- **Groq AI** (for response generation)
